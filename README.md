### Data Setting and Methods
**Data on COVID-19:** This dataset includes the COVID-19 cases and deaths in 207 countries from December 2019 to October 2023. I hope to observe how COVID-19 originating from Asia affects the US stock market and how the stock price was correlated with the COVID-19 numbers.
**S&P 500 historical price:** It will be obtained through Kaggle. The dataset contains day-to-day open and close prices from 2010 to present. I will calculate daily returns for the S&P 500 companies. Return is the key metric used in the project to build the portfolio.
**List of S&P 500 companies:** This dataset contains the company name, symbol, sector, industry, market cap, and EBITDA. They are useful features because they combined price data to show the performance of companies in various industries during the pandemic, helping me develop the stock-picking strategy.
**Stock information:** This dataset will be obtained through Yahoo Finance. Beta is the main information I need as it implies the diversification of the portfolio and allows me to use the CAPM to evaluate the portfolio.
**Risk-free Rate:** This dataset will be obtained through Kaggle. Risk-free rate is an essential part in the CAPM formula and I use 10-year treasury yield as the risk-free rate.
